        Object of the game: determine where all 9 mines are without clicking on
        a square that contains one. The squares that contain a number indicate
        how many clickable squares within its radius contain a mine. Watch the
        time! When it hits zero, the game is over.

        In the game, the snake is trying to eat an object (Food). The player
        controls the snake by roaming around, using the direction bottoms
        (right, left, up, and down keys) to play the game and make the snake eat
        the food object. The player must avoid the snake from hitting its own
        tail or the walls; if the snake does, then the game will be over and for
        playing again they need to start again.

        Carefully place pieces as they fall from the top of the screen. Try and
        conform them to other pieces. If a horizontal line is completed, the
        line will break and your score will increase! The longer the game goes
        on, the faster the pieces will fall. Good luck! (Please note that the
